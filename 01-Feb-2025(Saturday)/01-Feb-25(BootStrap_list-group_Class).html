          1) list-group Class in BootStrap
          - The list-group class in Bootstrap is used to create a flexible and styled list of items. It's a simple way to display a series of related items, like links, text, or buttons, in a clean and organized way. Each item in the list is styled with consistent spacing, borders, and background colors.

            2) list-group-item Class in BootStrap
            - In Bootstrap, the list-group-item class is used to style individual items within a list. When applied to an element, it makes the list item look visually distinct by adding padding, borders, and sometimes background colors, depending on the context. It's often used with the list-group class to create a grouped list, where each item appears as a part of a neatly formatted, organized list.
