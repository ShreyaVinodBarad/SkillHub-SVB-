            1) What is ViewPort?
            => The viewport is the visible area of a web page on a userâ€™s screen. It's the part of the website that you can see without scrolling. The size of the viewport depends on the device being used (like a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone).
            - Example:-
            1) On a desktop computer, the viewport is usually large because the screen is wide.
            2) On a mobile phone, the viewport is smaller because the screen is narrow.

            /*

            => What is vh?
            - The vh unit in CSS stands for "viewport height."
            1) Viewport:- 
            - This is the visible area of your browser window. 
            2) Height:- 
            - The vh measures how tall the viewport is.
            => How it works:- 
            - 1vh equals 1% of the total height of the viewport.
            => Example:-
            - If the browser's height is 1000px, then 1vh = 10px.
            - If you set something to 50vh, it will take 50% of the browser's height (500px in this case).
            => Common Use:-
            - To make elements responsive to the screen size.
            - Example:- 
            A full-screen section can be set as `height: 100vh;` to always take up the full height of the browser window, regardless of the screen size.
            => It's a handy unit for building layouts that adjust dynamically based on the screen's height!

            width: 50vw;
            /*  
            ðŸ‘†
            => What is vw? 
            - vw stands for viewport width and is a CSS unit used to measure lengths or sizes relative to the width of the browser's viewport - the visible area of a web page.
            => Key Points:-
            1) 1vw = 1% of the viewport's width
            - If the viewport is 1000 pixels wide, 1vw equals 10 pixels - 1% of 1000 pixels.
            2) Responsive sizing:-
            - Since vw adjusts based on the width of the viewport, it's great for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
            => Summary:-
            - In summary, vw helps you create flexible designs that change size dynamically based on the width of the screen.
