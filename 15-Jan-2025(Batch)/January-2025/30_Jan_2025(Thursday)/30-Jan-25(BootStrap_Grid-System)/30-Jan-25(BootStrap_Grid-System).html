        - In Bootstrap, the .container class creates a responsive fixed-width layout that centers content and provides appropriate side margins. It automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring readability by adding padding inside. 
        - Overall, using .container facilitates the development of organized and consistent web layouts.

            - .row in Bootstrap Grid System is a wrapper that organizes columns horizontally, ensuring consistent layout and proper alignment and spacing within the grid. 
            - It acts as a container for .col classes that determine column width relative to the total grid.

            - In the Bootstrap Grid System, .col-lg-12 is a class that defines a column that takes up the entire width of the grid on large screens.
            - Here's a breakdown:-
            1) col:
            - This indicates that it's a column.
            2) lg: 
            - This stands for "large" and refers to large screen sizes (typically desktops).
            3) 12: 
            - The number 12 represents the total grid columns (Bootstrap divides the grid into 12 equal parts). So, `12` means this column occupies all 12 parts.
            => In simple terms, .col-lg-12 makes the column full-width on large screens, allowing no space for other columns next to it.
