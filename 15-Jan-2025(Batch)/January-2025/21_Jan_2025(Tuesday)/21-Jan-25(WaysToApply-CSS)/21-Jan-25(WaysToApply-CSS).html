==> Ways to Apply CSS are:-
1) Internal CSS
2) External CSS
3) Inline CSS
==> Among the Ways to Apply CSS which will Apply to the Web Page is based on Sequence!
==> If Internal CSS is applied below External CSS the Web Page will aquire the External CSS.
==> But, if Internal CSS is below External CSS the Web Page will aquire the Internal CSS.
==> If we are Applying Inline CSS it will always aquire Inline CSS! As it is below and applied inside <body> Tag.
==> Whereas the Internal and External CSS are applied inside <head> Tag. We can only regulate which CSS to apply to Web Page Internal or External CSS as they are place in the same Tag i.e. <head> Tag and most importantly we can change it's Sequence!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
==> What is !important which is applied in CSS's Property's value?
=> In CSS, !important is a rule added to a property value to make sure it overrides any other styles, no matter where they come from (inline, internal, or external stylesheets). 
=> For example:-
p {
  color: red !important; 
}
p {
  color: blue;
}
=> In this case, the paragraph will be red because - !important gives that rule the highest priority.
