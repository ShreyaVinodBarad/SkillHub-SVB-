Here, Specificity means the Priority that is given to CSS's Selectors i.e.;
1) Id Selector
2) Class Selector
3) Tag Selector
So, if we give a same CSS to this Selectors then the 1st Priority is given to Id Selector, 2nd is given to Class Selector and 3rd Priority is given to Tag Selector. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
==> What is Specificity in CSS?
=> CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. It works by giving a weight to different types of selectors:-
1) Inline styles:- 
=> Example:-
(style='color: red;') -> have the highest specificity.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2) IDs:-
=> Example:- 
#header -> have the 2nd highest Specificity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3) Class's:-
=> Example:-
.Test -> have the 3rd highest Specificity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
4) Element or Tag Selector:-
=> Example:-
h1 -> have the 4th or lowest Specificity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
==> The more specific a selector is, the higher its weight and the more likely it is to apply the style. 
==> If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS will be applied.
