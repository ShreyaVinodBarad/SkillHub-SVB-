            => This block of code is a CSS reset, which is used to make sure your web page starts with consistent default styles across different browsers. 
            => Here's a simple breakdown:-
            1. padding: 0;  
            - It removes any default inner space (padding) that browsers add around elements.
            2. margin: 0;  
            - It removes any default outer space (margin) that browsers add around elements.
            3. box-sizing: border-box;  
            - It ensures that the width and height of elements include padding and borders, so your layout is easier to control. 
            - For example, if you set the width of a box to 100px, it will always be 100px, regardless of padding or borders.
            => By applying this reset to all elements (`*`), you eliminate unwanted differences in how browsers display your page, making your designs more predictable and consistent.

            /*  
            ðŸ‘†  
            => The background-repeat: no-repeat; property in CSS means the background image will only appear once and won't be repeated across the element.
            => Example:-
            - If you have a small image as a background, it wonâ€™t tile (copy itself) horizontally or vertically.
            - The image will stay in its original size and position, appearing only once.
            => This is useful when you just want a single background image without it repeating.

            background-size: cover;
            /*
            ðŸ‘†  
            => Here, by default the Image will Stretch from Right - Top!
            => The background-size: cover; property is used to make a background image fill the entire area of an element, such as a box, section, or webpage. 
            => Here's how it works:-
            - The image will stretch or shrink so that it covers the whole area without leaving any empty spaces.
            - Parts of the image might get cropped if the proportions of the image and the element donâ€™t match exactly.
            - It ensures the background always looks complete and doesnâ€™t repeat or leave gaps.
            => Think of it like resizing a picture to fit perfectly over a frame, even if some edges get cut off.
            */
            background-position: left bottom;
            /* 
            ðŸ‘† 
            => We can change the stretching property from Left - Bottom!
            => The background-position property in CSS is used to control where the background image appears inside an element. 
            => When you set background-position: left bottom;, here's what happens:-
            1) left:- 
            - The background image starts from the left edge of the element horizontally.
            2) bottom:- 
            - The background image starts from the bottom edge of the element vertically.
            => In simple terms, the image is placed in the bottom-left corner of the element.
