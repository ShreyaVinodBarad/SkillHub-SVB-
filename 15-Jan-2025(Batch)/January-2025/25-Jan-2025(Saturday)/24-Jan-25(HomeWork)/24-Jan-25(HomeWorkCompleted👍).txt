1) What are the possible ways to apply CSS styles to a web page?
==> There are three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page:-
a) Inline CSS:-
- Styles are added directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
- Example:-
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">
    This is red text.
</p>
b) Internal CSS:-
- Styles are written inside a <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML file.
- Example:-
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
c) External CSS:-
- Styles are written in a separate .css file, and the file is linked to the HTML using a <link> tag.
- Example:-
1) In HTML:-
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
2) In styles.css:-
p 
{
  color: green;
  font-size: 16px;
}
=> Note:-
- Inline CSS is best for small, specific changes.
- Internal CSS is good for styling a single page.
- External CSS is ideal for applying styles to multiple pages, keeping the code clean and reusable.

2) What are some new features in CSS3?
==> CSS3 introduced several powerful features for web design, enhancing responsiveness:-
a) Media Queries:- 
- Adjusts layout based on device size for responsive design.
b) Flexbox:- 
- Simplifies alignment of items in rows or columns.
c) Grid Layout:- 
- Organizes content into rows and columns for complex layouts.
d) Transitions & Animations:-
- Creates smooth effects during element changes.
e) Border Radius:- 
- Enables rounded corners on elements.
f) Box Shadows:- 
- Adds depth with shadow effects.
g) Text Shadows:- 
- Enhances text with stylish shadow effects.
h) Gradients:-  
- Provides smooth color transitions for backgrounds.
i) Custom Fonts:- 
- Uses unique web fonts via `@font-face`.
j) Opacity:- 
- Controls transparency of elements.
k) Transform:- 
- Manipulates elements by rotating or scaling them.
l) Pseudo-Classes & Elements:- 
- Targets specific states or parts of elements.
m) Multiple Backgrounds:- 
- Allows multiple background layers on one element.
n) Variable Support:- 
- Defines reusable CSS values for easier theming.
==> These features enable the creation of modern, attractive, and responsive web designs.

3) What is universal selector in css?
==> The universal selector in CSS is represented by an asterisk (`*`). 
- It selects all elements on the page, regardless of their type. 
==> Example:-
* 
{
    color: blue;
}
- This will turn the text color of every element on the page to blue. 
==> It's useful when you want to apply a style to all elements at once.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Explain the difference between classes and IDs in CSS.
==> In CSS, both classes and IDs are used to apply styles to elements, but they work a bit differently:-
a) Class:- 
- A class is used to style multiple elements.
- It‚Äôs reusable, so you can apply it to as many elements as you like.
- Classes are written with a `.` (dot) before the name (e.g., `.button`).
b) ID:-
- An ID is used to style one specific element.
- It must be unique, meaning no two elements on the page should have the same ID.
- IDs are written with a `#` (hash) before the name (e.g., `#header`).
==> In short:-  
- Class = multiple elements, reusable (.class).
- ID    = one unique element, not reusable (#id).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Explain box model in CSS.
==> The CSS box model is a way of describing how elements on a webpage are structured and how their size is calculated. 
==> Each element is considered a "box" made up of four parts:-
a) Content:- 
- The actual text or image inside the box.
b) Padding:- 
- Space between the content and the border. It‚Äôs like inner cushioning.
c) Border:- 
- A line around the padding (if you add one).
d) Margin:- 
- Space outside the border, separating the element from others.
==> When you set the size of an element (like width or height), it only affects the content area. 
==> Padding, border, and margin add extra space outside of the content box. 
==> In short, the box model defines how much space an element takes up on the page, considering all these parts.
