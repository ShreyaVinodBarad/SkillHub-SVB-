            👆
            ==> Here, sticky works as fixed value of position property. 
            ==> But when we write - top: 0; then we scroll down and that property top which as value 0 will come into play i.e.; the element will stick to the top position when it reaches top - 0 and get fixed there. It keeps an element in view within its container when you scroll, until the container's boundary is reached.
