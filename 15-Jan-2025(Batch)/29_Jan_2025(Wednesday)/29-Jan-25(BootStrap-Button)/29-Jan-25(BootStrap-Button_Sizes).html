<!--  
=> Bootstrap provides several button sizes that can be used to make buttons larger, smaller, or default size. These sizes help control the look and feel of buttons in your web design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Sizes of Buttons are:-
1) Default Button Size (btn):-
- This is the normal, standard size button. Its the most commonly used button size and doesn't require any extra classes beyond btn and the button color class (e.g., btn-primary).
2) Large Button Size (btn-lg):-
- The .btn-lg class is used to make buttons bigger than the default size. This can be helpful when you want to make the button stand out more or improve accessibility by making it easier for users to click or tap.
3) Small Button Size (btn-sm):-
- The .btn-sm class is used to make buttons smaller than the default size. This can be useful when you want a more compact design, or if you're using buttons in smaller spaces like a toolbar.
4) Extra Small Button Size (btn-xs):-
- While this size was used in earlier versions of Bootstrap (before version 4), it's no longer available in Bootstrap 4 and later versions. Instead, you can use the .btn-sm for smaller button sizes.
