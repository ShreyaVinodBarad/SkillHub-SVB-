==> Attributes for img Tag:-
1) height:-
Gives certain height in pixels to the Image!
2) alt:-
Alternative Text
- If in case your image is deleted from the website then in place of that, what that image defines is displayed in the form of text!
- alt Attribute is also used for SEO(Search Engine Optimization) because when we host our website on Search Engines then bascically Google doesn't Search for the Image it uses the Text given in the alt Attribute and displays the result to the search of the humans! 
And if we want our products to get displayed on the 1 page of Google then proper text should be given to the images so that when the human searches for anything the google gets the data from alt attribute and directly displays the result!
