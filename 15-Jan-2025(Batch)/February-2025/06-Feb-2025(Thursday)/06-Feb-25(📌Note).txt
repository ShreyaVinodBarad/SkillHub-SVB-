📌 Note:-
I participated in the online session today! Additionally, Akash Sir demonstrated how to create a repository on your GitHub account in order to push code to GitHub.
Lastly, we hosted Project-4, a website, on GitHub Pages.
Following the conclusion of the session, Sir stated that he would begin using Tailwind tomorrow and requested that you review some tutorials to have a basic understanding of what Tailwind is.
