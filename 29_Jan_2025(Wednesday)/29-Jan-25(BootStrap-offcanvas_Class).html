<!--  
=> The Bootstrap Offcanvas component is used to create a hidden sidebar (or panel) that slides in and out from the side of the screen. It is often used for navigation menus, sidebars, or additional content that doesnâ€™t need to be shown all the time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> How It Works:-
a) Hidden by Default:- 
- The offcanvas panel is not visible initially.
b) Trigger Button:- 
- Clicking a button or link makes the offcanvas panel slide in.
c) Close Button:- 
- You can close it using a button or by clicking outside the panel.
d) Positioning:- 
- It can slide in from the left, right, top, or bottom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Different Offcanvas Positions:-
Class Name	          |        Effect
---------------------------------------------------
offcanvas-start	               Opens from the left
offcanvas-end	                 Opens from the right
offcanvas-top	                 Opens from the top
offcanvas-bottom	             Opens from the bottom
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Understanding the Header & Body in Offcanvas:-
- When you create an offcanvas component, it has two main parts:
a) Offcanvas Header:-
- This is the top part of the offcanvas.
- It helps users understand what the offcanvas is about and allows them to close it.
b) Offcanvas Body:-
- This is the main content area of the offcanvas.
- You can add text, images, buttons, forms, or any other content here.
It scrolls if the content is long.
