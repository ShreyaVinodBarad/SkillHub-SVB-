1) What is Server-Side?
- When you visit a website, two main things are happening:
a) Front-end (Client-side): What you see in your browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
b) Back-end (Server-side): The hidden part that runs on a server. It handles requests, stores data, processes logic, and sends results back.
- Example:
a) When you log in to Facebook:
- You type your email and password → sent to the server.
- The server-side program checks if your details are correct.
1) If correct → sends back your profile page.
2) If wrong → sends back an error message.

2) Python as a Server-Side Language
- Python can be used to write the back-end logic of a website.
- It's not just for data science or scripting—it can actually run websites.
- But Python doesn't do it alone—it uses frameworks.

3) Flask (Python Framework for Web)
- Flask is a lightweight framework in Python that helps us quickly build websites and web apps.
- Think of Flask as a toolbox that gives you ready-made tools so you don't have to build everything from scratch.

4) How Flask Works (in simple steps)
a) A user types a URL (like http://example.com).
b) Flask receives the request on the server.
c) You (as the developer) tell Flask what to do for that URL (e.g., show a page, return data).
d) Flask sends back a response (like an HTML page or JSON data).

5) Why use Flask?
- Easy to learn and use.
- Good for beginners and small-to-medium web apps.
- Flexible—you add only what you need.
- Used for APIs, web apps, even AI apps.

6) So in short:
- Flask lets Python act as the server-side brain of a website—handling requests, doing processing, and sending responses back to users.
