/*
1) What is Arrow Function? 
- Arrow functions in JavaScript are a shorter way to write functions. They were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and are often used because they make code cleaner and more concise.

// Named Function ðŸ‘‡
function add(n1, n2) {
    return n1 + n2
}

// Arrow Function ðŸ‘‡
const sum = (n1, n2) => {
    return n1 + n2
}
console.log(sum(2, 3))

// If we are having single statment to return there is no need of return keyword and {} ðŸ‘‡
// If u are having single parameter than there is no need of () ðŸ‘‡
const sq = arg => arg * arg

const db = n1 => {

const demo = (n1, n2) => [n1, n2]
console.log(demo(2, 3))

// If u are returnung an object as one statement then in arrow function you have to use {} because compiler may get confused whether the {} are for obj or fun body. ðŸ‘‡
