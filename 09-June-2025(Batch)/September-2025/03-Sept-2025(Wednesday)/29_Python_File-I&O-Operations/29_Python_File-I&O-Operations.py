"""
1) What is I/O?
- I/O means Input/Output.
- Input = reading data from a file.
- Output = writing data into a file.

2) When working with files in Python, you usually do 3 steps:
a) Open the file
b) Read or Write
c) Close the file

3) File Modes (important!)
a) "r" â†’ read (file must exist).
b) "w" â†’ write (creates a new file or erases old content).
c) "a" â†’ append (adds data at the end).
d) "r+" â†’ read + write.
e) "w+" â†’ write + read (erases old content).
f) "a+" â†’ append + read.

1) What is seek()?
- Every file in Python has a file pointer (like a cursor in a text editor).
- When you open a file and write something, the pointer moves to the end of the written text.
- If you try to read() immediately, Python starts reading from the current pointer position â†’ which is already at the end â†’ so it returns empty.
- That's why we use file.seek(0) to move the pointer back to the beginning.
