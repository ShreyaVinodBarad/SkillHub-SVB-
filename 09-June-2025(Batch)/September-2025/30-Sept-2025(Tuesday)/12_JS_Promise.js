/*
- A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- A Promise acts as a placeholder for a value that youâ€™ll get in the future, like data from a server.
It helps handle asynchronous tasks without using deeply nested callbacks (callback hell).
- States of a Promise:
a) Pending â†’ The operation is still running.
b) Fulfilled â†’ The operation completed successfully (resolve).
c) Rejected â†’ The operation failed (reject).
*/
const x = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Line of code...
    // reject() => Promise Fail
    // resolve() => Promise Success
    resolve("Complete Successfully!")
    // reject("Network Issue!")
})
x
    .then((data) => console.log("Success!", data)) // Runs when Resolve
    // ðŸ‘† .then() is called when the promise is resolved.
    .catch((err) => console.log("Fail!", err)) // Runs when Reject
// ðŸ‘† .catch () is called when the promise is rejected.

const test = async () => {
    try {
        data = await x
        console.log("Done!", data)
    }

- await pauses the function until the promise resolves or rejects.
- try...catch handles success and error cases.
