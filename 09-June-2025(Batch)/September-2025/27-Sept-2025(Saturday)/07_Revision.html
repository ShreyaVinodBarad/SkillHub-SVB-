    <!-- 
    👆
    - This creates an <h1> element with a custom attribute called data-skillhub.
    - The value of this attribute is "hello".
    - data-* attributes are HTML5 custom attributes used to store extra information on elements.
    - In this case, you’re storing "hello" as metadata.

    Semantic Tags 👇 
    - Semantic tags in HTML are special tags that tell the meaning or purpose of the content inside them — both to the browser and to developers.
    - In simple words:
    Semantic tags make your webpage more understandable — they describe what each part of the page is for.
    - Semantic tags make your webpage meaningful, organized, and easier for everyone to understand — humans, browsers, and search engines.
    - Example:
    header, section, article, footer, etc.

    flex-direction: column;
    👆
    a) flex-direction property
    - It controls the direction of the flex items inside the container.
    b) flex-direction: column
    - This makes the flex items stack vertically, from top to bottom (like a column).
    c) Summary: 
    | Property                 | Direction     | Layout     |
    | ------------------------ | --------------| ---------- |
    | flex-direction: row      | Left ➡ Right | Horizontal |
    | flex-direction: column   | Top ⬇ Bottom  | Vertical   |

    Things to remember while using Media Query:-
    a) Avoid apply height and width => Use max-width and max-heigth
    b) Avoid using px(Absolute Units) and use %, em, rem (Relative Units)

    <!-- 
    height: 100dvh
    👆
    - This means the element’s height will be 100% of the device’s viewport height — using dynamic viewport height (dvh).
    a) What is dvh?
    - dvh stands for Dynamic Viewport Height.
    - 1dvh = 1% of the visible height of the browser or screen right now.
    - 100dvh = 100% of the visible height — the full height of the current screen.
    b) Why “dynamic”?
    - It’s called dynamic because it changes automatically if the visible area of the screen changes — for example:
    1) When the address bar or keyboard appears or disappears on mobile.
    2) When the screen rotates (portrait ↔ landscape).
    - So, the layout adjusts smoothly!
    c) Difference between vh and dvh
    1) Unit: vh
    a) Viewport Height
    b) Fixed — doesn’t change when screen UI changes (like mobile address bar)
    c) Desktop layouts
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    2) Unit: dvh
    a) Dynamic Viewport Height
    b) Adjusts dynamically with visible screen changes
    c) Mobile-friendly layouts
    - dvh = Dynamic Viewport Height → it keeps your design flexible and mobile-friendly by adapting to the visible screen size in real time.

    aspect-ratio => The aspect-ratio property in CSS controls the shape of an element — it decides how wide and how tall it should be in relation to each other.
    - aspect-ratio keeps a fixed width-to-height ratio — so the element doesn’t look stretched.

    <!-- 
    object-fit => The object-fit property in CSS tells the browser how an image or video should fit inside its container (like a box or frame)
    - It’s mostly used with the <img> or <video> tag.
    a) fill => Stretches the image to fill the box (may look squished)
    b) contain => Fits the whole image inside the box (no cropping)
    c) cover => Fills the box completely (some parts may be cropped)
    d) none => Keeps the original size (might overflow)
    e) scale-down => Chooses the smaller of none or contain
