"""
1) What is a Dictionary in Python?
- A dictionary is like a real-life dictionary.
- In a real dictionary, you look up a word (like "apple") to find its meaning ("a fruit").
- In Python, a dictionary also works with key â†’ value pairs.
Key = the word you search
Value = the meaning you get

2) Key Points:
- Dictionary is written inside { } curly braces.
- It stores data in key : value pairs.
- Keys must be unique.
- Values can be of any type (number, string, list, another dictionary, etc.).
