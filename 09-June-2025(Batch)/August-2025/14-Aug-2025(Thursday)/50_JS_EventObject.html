    <!--  
    1) What is an Event Variable? 
    - In JavaScript, the event variable (often written as e or evt) refers to the Event object that gets automatically passed to your event handler when an event is triggered.
    - It contains information about what happened — for example, which element was clicked, what key was pressed, mouse position, and more.
    
    2) Common Properties:
    a) event.type → Type of event (click, change, keydown, etc.)
    b) event.target → Element that triggered the event
    c) event.currentTarget → Element the listener is attached to
    d) event.preventDefault() → Stops default browser behavior
    e) event.stopPropagation() → Stops event bubbling
    
    3) Best Practice:
    - Always name it something (event, e, or evt) instead of relying on a global event object — because in strict mode or in modern browsers, that global might not exist.

    <button type="button" id="myBtn">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
            console.log(event);  // Full event object => An object
            console.log(event.type);  // Event type (e.g., "click") => click
            console.log(event.target);  // The element that triggered the event => <button type="button" id="myBtn">Click Me</button>
        })
    </script>
