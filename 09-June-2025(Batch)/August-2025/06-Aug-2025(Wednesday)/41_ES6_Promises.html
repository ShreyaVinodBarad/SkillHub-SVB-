    <!--  
    => A Promise in JavaScript is a way to handle something that will happen in the future, like data coming from a server.
    -->
    <!--  
    1) What is a Promise?
    - A Promise is like a guarantee of a result in the future. It is used when something takes time to finish — like downloading data, reading a file, etc.
    - Think of it like ordering food online:
    a) You place the order (you make a request).
    b) You wait (the app says “order in progress”).
    c) The food arrives or fails to arrive.
    d) A Promise works the same way.

    2) Why Promises?
    - In JavaScript, many tasks take time (like fetching data from the internet). Instead of stopping everything and waiting, we use Promises to:
    a) Keep doing other things while waiting for the result
    b) Know when the result is ready (success or failure)
    
    3) States of a Promise
    - A Promise has 3 states:
    a) Pending – still waiting
    b) Fulfilled – done successfully
    c) Rejected – something went wrong
    
    4) Promise Syntax
    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        // Do something (like fetch data)
        if (/* success */) {
            resolve("Success!");
        } else {
            reject("Error!");
        }
    });
    - resolve() means: success
    - reject() means: failed

    5) Using .then() and .catch()
    promise
    .then(function(result) {
        console.log("Result: " + result); // when resolved
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        console.log("Error: " + error);   // when rejected
    });

    6) In Short:
    - Promises handle things that take time (like loading data).
    - They either succeed (resolve) or fail (reject).
    - We use .then() for success and .catch() for errors.

        let orderPizza = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            let isPizzaReady = true;
            if (isPizzaReady) {
                resolve("Pizza is Ready!");
            }
            else {
                reject("Pizza is not ready yet!");
            }
        });
        orderPizza.then(function (msg) {
            console.log("Yay!" + msg);
        }).catch(function (err) {
            console.log("Oops!" + err);
        })

        // Examples by Akash Sir 👇
        const handleSuccess = (arg) => console.log("Success", arg);
        // 👆 This function will be called if the promise is successful.
        const handleFail = () => console.log("Fail");
        // 👆 This function will be called if the promise fails.
        const x = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // 👆 You’re creating a new Promise named x.
            resolve("Dell");
            /*
            👆
            - This means: "Everything went well — here’s the result: Dell".
            - So, this promise is resolved with the value "Dell".
            */
        });
        x
            .then(handleSuccess)
            /*
            👆
            .then(handleSuccess) means:
            - If the promise is successful, call handleSuccess("Dell")
            - Output: Success Dell
            */
            .catch(handleFail);
        /*
            👆
        .catch(handleFail) means:
        - If the promise is rejected, call handleFail()
        - But this won’t happen here because the promise was resolved, not rejected.
        */

        👆
        - This line calls the fetch() function, which is used to make an HTTP request (in this case, a GET request) to the given API URL.
        - fetch() returns a Promise that will eventually resolve to a Response object from the server.
        */
        result
            .then((data) => {
                return data.json();
            })
            /*
            👆
            - When the response comes back, take it (we're calling it data), and now convert it to real JavaScript using .json().            
            - So:
            a) data is the response object from the server.
            b) It contains all the information sent back, including the actual user data, headers, status, etc.
            c) But this data is in a special format (called a Response object), so you can't use it directly.
            - Why data.json()?
            a) The server usually sends data in JSON format (looks like text), and we want to convert it into a real JavaScript object so we can use it. 
            - data.json():
            a) Converts that response into real, usable JavaScript (like arrays or objects).
            b) Also returns another Promise, which is why we chain another .then() after it.
