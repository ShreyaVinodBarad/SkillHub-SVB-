"""
1) break
- It is used to stop the loop completely.
- As soon as Python sees break, the loop ends immediately (even if it hasn't finished all its turns).

2) continue
- It is used to skip the current turn of the loop.
- The loop does not stop, it just skips that one round and moves to the next.

3) In short:
break = stop the loop.
continue = skip one turn, but keep the loop going.

"""
ðŸ‘‰ Why two times?
First a = a + 1 (inside if) ensures we don't get stuck at 4.
Second a = a + 1 (at the end) ensures the loop moves forward normally.
- Without these, the loop would either never end or repeat numbers.
