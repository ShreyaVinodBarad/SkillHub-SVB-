1) What is a variable?
- A variable is like a box with a name.
- You can store a value inside the box and later use it.

2) Why do we need variables?
- To store information (numbers, text, etc.).
- To reuse values instead of writing them again and again.

3) Rules for naming variables:
- Can use letters, numbers, and underscore _.
- Must start with a letter or underscore.
- Cannot start with a number.
- No spaces or special symbols allowed.
'''
varNum = 10 # Here, varNum is the box name, and inside it we put the number 10.
print(varNum)

'''
4) Different types of values you can store:
'''
name = "Shreya" # string (text)
num = 3.14 # float (decimal number)
integer = 20 # integer (number)
boolean = True  # boolean (True/False)

'''
5) Changing values:
- You can change whatâ€™s inside the variable box anytime.
'''
a = 10
a = 12
print(a) # 12

'''
6) In short:
- A variable is just a name that points to a value.
- It helps us store and reuse data in our program.
