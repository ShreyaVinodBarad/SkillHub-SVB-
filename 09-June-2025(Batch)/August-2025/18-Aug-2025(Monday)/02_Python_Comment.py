1) Comments in Python
- A comment is a note you write in your code to explain what it does.
- The computer ignores comments while running the program.
- They are only for humans (like you or other programmers) to understand the code better.

2) Types of Comments in Python
a) Single-line Comment
- Starts with #
- Everything after # on that line is ignored.
'''
# Single line comment

'''
b) Multi-line Comment 
- Not official, but usually written with triple quotes
- Used when you want to explain something in detail.
- Python treats it like a long string, but if its not assigned to a variable, it acts like a comment.

3) Why use comments?
- To explain what the code does.
- To remind yourself later why you wrote it that way.
- To make it easier for others to read your code.
