    <!--  
    1) What is Object Destructuring?
    - Object destructuring is a feature in ES6 (JavaScript) that lets you extract values from objects and assign them to variables easily.
    - Instead of accessing each property one by one, destructuring lets you do it in a short and clean way.

    2) Rename Variables (If needed):
    - If you want to use a different variable name.

    3) Why Use It?
    - Cleaner and shorter code
    - Helps when working with large objects
    - Often used in React, Node.js, etc.

    <script>
        // Normal way of using an Object! ðŸ‘‡
        const person = { name: "Gouri", age: 23, city: "London" };
        const myName = person.name;
        const myAge = person.age;
        const myCity = person.city;

        // Object Destructuring ðŸ‘‡
        const { name, age, city } = person;
        // const { age, name, city } = person; => Sequence does not matter
        console.log(name, age, city);
        /*
        console.log(name, age, city, x); 
        => ðŸ‘† x is not there in an object person so it returns - undefined 
        */
        /*
        => What's Happening?
        - { name, age, city } is the pattern you're using to pull out values from the object person.
        */

        // Rename Variables ðŸ‘‡
        const { name: MyName, age: MyAge, city: MyCity } = person;
        console.log(MyName, myAge, myCity);
    </script>
