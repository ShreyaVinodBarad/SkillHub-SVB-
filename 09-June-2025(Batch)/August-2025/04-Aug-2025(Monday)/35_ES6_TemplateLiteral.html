    <!--  
    1) What is a Template Literal?
    - Template Literals are a new way to work with strings in JavaScript, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
    - They make it easier to:
    a) Add variables into strings (without + sign).
    b) Write multi-line strings (without \n).
    c) Include expressions directly inside strings.

    2) How do we write a Template Literal?
    - We use backticks ( ` ` ) instead of quotes.
    
    3) What's inside ${}?
    - You can put:
    a) Variables
    b) Math
    c) Function calls
    d) Any JavaScript expression

    4) Why use Template Literals?
    - Cleaner and easier to read
    - Better for HTML templates or long strings
    - More powerful than old string methods

    5) Summary:
    | Feature            | Old Way               | Template Literal Way |
    | ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- |
    | Variable in string | "Hello " + name + "!" | `Hello ${name}!`     |
    | Multi-line string  | "Line1\nLine2"        | `Line1<br>Line2`     |
    | Expressions        | "Sum: " + (a + b)     | `Sum: ${a + b}`      |

        console.log(`Sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`);

        const poem = `This is line 1
        This is line 2      
        This is line 3`;
        console.log(poem);
