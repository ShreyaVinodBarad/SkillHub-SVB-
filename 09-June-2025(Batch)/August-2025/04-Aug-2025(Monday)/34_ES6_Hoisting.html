    <!--  
    1) What is Hoisting?
    - Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of the code before running it.
    - Example:

    2) What about let and const?
    - They are also hoisted, but not initialized. Thatâ€™s where TDZ comes in.

    3) What is TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)?
    - TDZ is the time between:
    a) When a let/const variable is hoisted
    - You cannot access the variable during this "dead zone". If you try, you get a ReferenceError.
    - When you declare a variable with let or const and try to access it before declaration then, where the line you declare that above it all the area is TDZ.
    - Hoisting makes the variable known to JavaScript.
    a) The declaration line (like let x = 10) is when:
    - The TDZ ends.
    - The variable becomes safe to use.
    => Example with TDZ:

    4) Summary Table:
    | Keyword| Hoisted?| Initialized?     | Before declaration?  |
    | -------| --------| -----------------| -------------------- |
    | var    |  Yes    |  Yes (undefined) |  Yes                 |
    | let    |  Yes    |  No              |  No (TDZ error)      |
    | const  |  Yes    |  No              |  No (TDZ error)      |

    5) Easy Trick to Remember:
    a) var is old-school: Itâ€™s hoisted and forgiving.
    b) let and const are modern: Theyâ€™re safer, and donâ€™t allow access before declaration (TDZ protects them).

    <script>
        console.log(a)   //undefined
        var a = 10;
        /*
        a) Why? 
        - Because JavaScript "hoists" the var a declaration to the top, like this:
        var a;       => declaration is hoisted
        console.log(a); => undefined
        a = 10;      => assignment happens here
        */

        console.log(b); // ReferenceError
        let b = 5;
        /*
        a) Why? 
        - Because the variable b is in the Temporal Dead Zone from the start of the block until the let b = 5; line.
        */

        console.log(x);   // ReferenceError
        let x = 10;
        /*
        ðŸ‘†
        - The line where you write let x = 10;, thatâ€™s when the variable is both declared and initialized.
        - Before that line:
        a) JavaScript knows that x exists (because of hoisting),
        b) But you canâ€™t use it â€” thatâ€™s the Temporal Dead Zone.
