    <!--  
    1) What is an Arrow Function?
    - An arrow function is a shorter way to write a function in JavaScript. 
    - It was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

    2) Easy Way to Remember:
    - Remove the word function
    - Add an => (arrow) after the parentheses
    - If it has only one line of code, you donâ€™t need curly brackets {} or return

    3) Difference from Regular Function:
    - Arrow functions:
    a) Don't have their own this (important in object-oriented code)
    b) Cannot be used as constructors (you can't use new with them)
