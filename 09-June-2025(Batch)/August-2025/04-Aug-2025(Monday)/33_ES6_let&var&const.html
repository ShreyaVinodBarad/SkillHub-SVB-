    <!--  
    1) var (Old way)
    - Introduced in: ES5 (old JavaScript)
    - Scope: Function-scoped – it only works inside the function where it's declared.
    - Hoisting: Yes (moved to the top of the scope, but not initialized)
    - Can be re-declared? Yes
    - Can be updated? Yes
    
    2) let (Modern way)
    - Introduced in: ES6
    - Scope: Block-scoped – works only within the block { } where it's declared.
    - Hoisting: Yes (but not usable until declared — called "temporal dead zone")
    - Can be re-declared? No (in the same scope)
    - Can be updated? Yes
    
    3) const (Constant)
    - Introduced in: ES6
    - Scope: Block-scoped
    - Hoisting: Yes (but same "temporal dead zone" as let)
    - Can be re-declared? No
    - Can be updated? ❌ No – it's a constant

    4) Summary Table:
    | Feature      | var      |   let | const   |
    | ------------ | -------- | ----- | ------- |
    | Scope        | Function | Block | Block   |
    | Hoisting     | Yes      | Yes   | Yes     |
    | Re-declare   | Yes      | No    | No      |
    | Update value | Yes      | Yes   | No      |
