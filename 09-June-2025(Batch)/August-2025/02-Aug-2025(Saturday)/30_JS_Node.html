    1) What is a Node?
    - A Node is a single point in the DOM (Document Object Model) tree. The DOM is a tree structure where everything in an HTML document is represented as a node.
    - There are different types of nodes, such as:
    | Node Type     | Example                      |
    | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | Element node  | <div>, <p>, <h1>             |
    | Text node     | Text inside an element       |
    | Comment node  |  This is a comment           |
    | Document node | document object itself       |
    
    2) What is an HTML Element?
    - An HTML Element is a type of node — specifically an element node — which represents tags like <div>, <input>, <button>, etc.
    - So when we say "node known as an HTML element," we’re specifically talking about element nodes. 
     
    3) Example:
    <body>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
    </body>
    In the DOM:
    - The <body> is an element node.
    - The <h1> is also an element node.
    - The text "Hello" inside <h1> is a text node.

    4) Summary:
    - A node is any item in the DOM tree (element, text, comment, etc.).
    - An HTML element is a node that represents an HTML tag.
    - All HTML elements are nodes, but not all nodes are HTML elements.
