    1) What are Modules?
    - Modules in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) are a way to organize your code by splitting it into smaller, reusable files.
    - You can export things (like functions, variables, classes) from one file, and import them into another.
    - Think of modules like separate boxes ðŸ§° â€“ each box has tools inside, and you can choose which tools to take out and use.
    
    2) Why Use Modules?
    - Keeps your code clean and organized
    - Allows reuse of code across files
    - Prevents naming conflicts
    - Makes collaboration easier

    3) There are two main types of exports:
    a) Named Exports
    - You can export multiple values by name.
    - Syntax (exporting):
    file: mathUtils.js
    export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
    - Syntax (importing):
    import { add, subtract } from './mathUtils.js';
    => ðŸ‘† You must use the exact names when importing.

    b) Default Export
    - You can export one single default value per file.
    - Syntax (exporting):
    const log = (message) => console.log(message);
    export default log;
    - Syntax (importing):
    import log from './logger.js';
    => ðŸ‘† You can name the import anything you want.

    c) You Can Also Combine Both
    file: helper.js
    export const greet = () => console.log("Hello!");
    export default function sayBye() {
        console.log("Bye!");
    }
    => Importing:
    file: app.js
    import sayBye, { greet } from './helper.js';

    <script type="module" src="./45_ES6_Modules(Import).js"></script>
    <!-- ðŸ‘† type="module" is required to use import and export -->
