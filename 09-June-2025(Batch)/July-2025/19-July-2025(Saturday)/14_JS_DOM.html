    1) What is DOM?
    - DOM = Document Object Model.
    - It is like a tree structure that the browser creates when it loads your HTML page.
    - It represents all elements of your webpage as objects that JavaScript can see and change.

    2) Why is DOM important in JS?
    - JavaScript uses the DOM to change content, styles, or structure of your webpage while it is running.

    3) In super simple words:
    - DOM = A bridge between your HTML and JavaScript so you can change your webpage using code.

    <h1>Hello</h1>

    <script>
        console.log(document); // Here "document" is a Object of JS!
        console.log(document.getElementsByTagName("h1"));
    </script>
