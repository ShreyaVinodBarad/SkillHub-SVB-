    <!-- 
    1) What are Operators?
    - Operators are special symbols used to perform actions on values or variables.
    
    2) Types of Operators in JavaScript
    a) Arithmetic Operators (do maths)
    - Used for mathematical calculations:
    + ➔ Addition (5 + 3 is 8)
    - ➔ Subtraction (5 - 2 is 3)
    * ➔ Multiplication (4 * 2 is 8)
    / ➔ Division (10 / 2 is 5)
    % ➔ Modulus (remainder) (5 % 2 is 1)
    ** ➔ Exponentiation (2 ** 3 is 8)
    ++ ➔ Increment (x++ increases x by 1)
    -- ➔ Decrement (x-- decreases x by 1)

    b) Assignment Operators (assign values)
    - Used to assign values to variables:
    = ➔ Assign (let x = 5) 
    += ➔ Add and assign (x += 3 means x = x + 3)
    -= ➔ Subtract and assign
    *= ➔ Multiply and assign
    /= ➔ Divide and assign
    %= ➔ Modulus and assign

    c) Comparison Operators (compare values)
    - Used to compare two values:
    == ➔ Equal to (5 == '5' is true) (checks value, not type)
    === ➔ Equal value and type (5 === '5' is false)
    != ➔ Not equal (5 != 3 is true)
    !== ➔ Not equal value or type
    > ➔ Greater than
    < ➔ Less than
    >= ➔ Greater than or equal to
    <= ➔ Less than or equal to

    d) Logical Operators (combine conditions)
    - Used for checking multiple conditions:
    && ➔ AND (both conditions must be true)
    || ➔ OR (at least one condition must be true)
    ! ➔ NOT (reverses true to false, or false to true) 

    e) String Concatenation Operator
    + ➔ Joins strings together

        let z = 10 + 20 * 10;
        /*
        1) BODMAS stands for:
        B ➔ Brackets
        O ➔ Orders (powers, roots like 2^3, √4)
        D ➔ Division
        M ➔ Multiplication
        A ➔ Addition
        S ➔ Subtraction

        Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100
        */
        console.log((45 / 50) * 100);
