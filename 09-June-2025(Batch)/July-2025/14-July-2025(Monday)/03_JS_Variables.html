    1) What are Variables in JavaScript?
    - Variables are containers that store data so you can reuse it later.
    - Think of them like labeled boxes where you can put things (like numbers, text, etc.) and use them whenever you need.
    
    2) How to create a variable in JavaScript
    - We use three keywords:
    1) var (old, avoid using now)
    2) let (mostly used now)
    3) const (for values that should not change)

    3) Difference Between var, let and const:
    | Feature             |     var     |      let     |         const       |
    | ------------------- | ------------| ------------ | --------------------|
    | Can re-declare?     |  Yes        | No           |  No                 |
    | Can re-initialize?  |  Yes        | Yes          |  No                 |
    | Scope               | Function    | Block        | Block               |
    | Recommended now?    |  No         |  Yes         | Yes(fixed values)   |

          |    initialize   |   reinitialize   |   redeclare  |
    ------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|                 
    let   |    optional     |       yes        |     no       |
    const |    required     |       no         |     no       |

    4) How to Name a Variables in JS? 
    a) Can include:
    - Letters (a–z, A–Z)
    - Digits (0–9)
    - $ (dollar sign)
    - _ (underscore) 
    b) Cannot start with a digit.
    c) Cannot use spaces.
    d) Cannot use reserved keywords (like let, var, function, etc.) as variable names.

    5) camelCase
    a) What it is:
    - The first word is small, and each next word starts with a capital letter.
    b) Example:
    - userName, totalMarks, isLoggedIn
    
    6) snake_case
    a) What it is:
    - All letters are small, and words are separated using _ (underscore).
    b) Example:
    - user_name, total_marks, is_logged_in

    7) Variable names are case sensitive in JavaScript.
    - In simple words:
    name, Name, and NAME are three different variables in JavaScript.
    - JavaScript treats lowercase and uppercase letters as different when reading variable names.

        let num1 = 10;
        /*
        👆
        let     => Keyword
        num1    => Variable
        =       => Assignment Operator
        10      => Value of the Variable
        */
        const num2 = 10;
        console.log(num1) // 👈 Prints value of the variable num1
        console.log("Prints the data!")
        // 👆 Data written in quotes inside the consol.log will print as it is!

        let x;      // 👈 Declaration of the variable x
        x = 10;     // 👈 Initializtion of the variable x
        let y = 12; // 👈 Declaration + Initialization of the variable y

        /*
        ⭐ In const we have to Declare and Initialize at the same time or else it will show Error!
        */
