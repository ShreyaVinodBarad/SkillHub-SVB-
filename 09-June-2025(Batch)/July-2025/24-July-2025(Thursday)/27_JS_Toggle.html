    <!--  
    1) What the code does:
    - There is a button that says “Click Me”.
    - When you click the button, it runs the toggle() function.
    - Inside this function:
    a) It checks if x is true.
    - If true, it prints "Hello!" and changes x to false.
    - If false, it prints "Bye" and changes x to true.

    2) What toggle means here:
    - Toggle means switching between two states again and again.
    - In this code:
    a) The first click prints "Hello!" (x becomes false).
    b) The second click prints "Bye" (x becomes true).
    c) The third click prints "Hello!" again.
    d) The fourth click prints "Bye" again.
    - And this keeps repeating every time you click.
    
    3) Why this happens:
    - x starts as true.
    - Every time you click, the function switches x to the opposite:
    a) if true, it becomes false.
    b) if false, it becomes true.
    - This is why it alternates between “Hello!” and “Bye” on each click.
