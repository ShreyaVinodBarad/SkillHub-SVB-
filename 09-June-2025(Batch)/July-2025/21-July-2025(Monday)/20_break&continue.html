    <!--  
    1) break 
    a) What it does:
    - It stops the loop completely.
    b) When to use:
    - If you find what you need in a loop and donâ€™t want to check further, use break to exit.

    2) continue 
    a) What it does:
    - It skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
    b) When to use:
    - If you want to skip a particular value or condition but continue the loop, use continue.

    3) In short:
    a) break â†’ Stop the loop completely.
    b) continue â†’ Skip the current step, continue the loop.
