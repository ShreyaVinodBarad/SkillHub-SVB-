    1) What is a callback?
    - A callback is a function you pass as an argument to another function, which will be called (run) later.
    - In simple words: “Call me back when you are done.”
    - JavaScript uses callbacks to do things in order, especially for waiting and handling results later.

    2) Why do we need callbacks?
    - JavaScript is single-threaded (does one thing at a time).
    - But some tasks take time (like loading data, waiting for user input).
    - Instead of stopping everything, JavaScript:
    a) Starts the task.
    b) Continues other tasks.
    c) Calls the callback when the task finishes.

    3) What is a Higher Order Function?
    - A Higher Order Function (HOF) is: A function that does one (or both) of these:
    a) Takes another function as an argument.
    b) Returns another function.
    => Why is it called “higher order”?
    - Because it operates on functions, not just values.
    - Normal functions work with numbers, strings, etc.
    - HOFs can receive or give back other functions, making them “higher level.”
    => One-Line Definition:
    - A Higher Order Function is a function that takes a function or returns a function.

    <script>
        function sayHello(arg, x) {
            console.log(arg);
            x();
        }
        function sayBye() {
            console.log("Bye!");
        }
        // 👆 sayBye => Callback Function
        sayHello("Hello!", sayBye)
        // 👆 sayHello => Higher Order Function(HOF)
        /*
        👆
        Explanation of the above code:
        a) sayBye is a callback function because it is passed as an argument to another function (sayHello).
        b)sayHello is a Higher Order Function (HOF) because:
        - It takes a function as an argument (x).
        c) Inside sayHello:
        - console.log(arg); prints "Hello!".
        - x(); calls the callback sayBye.
        - sayBye runs, printing "Bye!".
        d) Output:
        Hello!
        Bye!
        e) How this explains callbacks:
        - A callback function is passed into another function (HOF) to be executed later.
        - In your code:
        sayBye is not called immediately when passed.
        It is called inside sayHello, when x(); executes.
        f) One-line summary:
        - sayBye is a callback. sayHello is a Higher Order Function that takes the callback and calls it later inside its body.
