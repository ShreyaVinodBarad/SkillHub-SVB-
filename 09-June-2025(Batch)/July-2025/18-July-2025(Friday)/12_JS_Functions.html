    <!--  
    1) What is a function in JavaScript?
    - A function in JavaScript is:
    a) A block of code that does a specific task.
    b) You can use it again and again without rewriting the same code.
    c) It helps keep your code clean and organized.

    2) Example:
    function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, Shreya!");
    }
    - Here:
    a) function â†’ tells JavaScript you are creating a function.
    b) greet â†’ the name of the function.
    c) { ... } â†’ contains the code that will run when you call the function.

    3) How to use (call) this function:
    greet(); 
    - It will print "Hello, Shreya!" in the console.
    - You can call function n number of times.

    4) What is the return keyword in JavaScript?
    - The return keyword is used inside a function to:
    a) Give back a value when the function is called.
    b) Stop the function immediately at that point.

    5) Why is return important?
    - Without return, a function does its work but does not give back any value.
    - With return, you can store, print, or use the value elsewhere.

        }
        greet();

        function add(a, b) {
            console.log(a + b);
        }
        add(2, 5);
        /*
        - Here:
        a) a and b are parameters (placeholders for values).
        b) add(2, 5) passes 2 and 5 to the function and 2 and 5 are called arguments.
        c) It prints their sum (7).
