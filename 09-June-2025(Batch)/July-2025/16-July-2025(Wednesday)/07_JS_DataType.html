    2) String: Text inside quotes.
    3) Boolean: Only true or false.
    4) Undefined: A variable declared but not assigned any value yet.
    5) Null: Represents "no value".
    6) BigInt: For very large numbers.
    7) Symbol: Unique value for identifiers (used in advanced cases).
    b) Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
    - These store collections or complex data.
    -  Objects and arrays are mutable (can change their contents).
    1) Object: Stores data in key-value pairs.
    2) Array: Stores multiple values in a list.
    3) Function: A block of code that performs a task.
