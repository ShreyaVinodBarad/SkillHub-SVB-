            1) width in CSS: 
            - It takes 2000px space at any cost. For width it doesn't matter whether space is there or not.
            - Because of width we will get a scroll bar, which is not a good practice to follow.
            - The width property sets how wide an element (like a box, div, image, etc.) should be.
            - You give it a fixed size like 200px, 50%, or 10rem.

            /*
            2) max-width  
            - If we provide max-width as 2000px then, it only take the avilable space and it does not spread if space is not avilable.
            - And it also helps us to avoide scroll bar which is good practice.
            - The max-width property sets the maximum width an element can grow to.
            - The element can be smaller, but it will never go wider than the max-width.

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h2>
    <!--  
    3) When to use each?
    - Use width when you want a fixed size.
    - Use max-width when you want it to be responsive (adjustable) but with a limit.
    - Try to avoid using "width" property while designing.
    -->
    <!--  
    4) Quick Example Together:
    div {
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 800px;
    }
    - This means:
    The div will stretch to fill the screen (100%),
    but it will never become wider than 800px.
