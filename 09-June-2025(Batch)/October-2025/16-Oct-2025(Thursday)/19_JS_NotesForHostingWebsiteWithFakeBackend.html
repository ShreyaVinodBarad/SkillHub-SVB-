- Sir, has given folder in which some changes are done:
a) Prepare Your Project Folder:
- Copy all your code files into the folder given by Sir.
- Move db.json (your fake database file) outside the public folder (keep it directly inside your main project folder).
- Delete db.json from the public folder if it’s there.
b) Install Node Modules
- Open your folder in VS Code or terminal.
- Run this command to install dependencies:
npm i
- This will create the node_modules folder (used by your index.js backend).
c) Run Project Locally
- In terminal, run:
node index.js
- The terminal will show:
JSON Server is running on http://localhost:5000
- This means your fake backend (API) is working.
d) Check the Frontend
- Open index.html in your browser — it connects to the fake backend (http://localhost:5000/products) defined in your
app.js
- You can add, update, or delete products, and the data will update inside db.json.
e) Upload Code to GitHub
- Push your whole project folder (except node_modules) to GitHub.
Example:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
git push -u origin main
f) In gitignore file write the folder that you don't want to push into GitHub, i.e., node_modules.
g) Host on Render
- Go to https://render.com
- Click New → Web Service.
- Connect your GitHub repo where your project is uploaded.
- Click Deploy — Render will host your backend and give a public URL (e.g. https://yourproject.onrender.com).
h) Update Frontend URLs
- In your home.js or app.js, change:
const URL = "http://localhost:5000/products"
to your Render URL:
const URL = "https://yourproject.onrender.com/products"
i) Refresh or Re-Deploy
- After changing the URL, push your changes to GitHub again.
- Render will automatically detect updates and re-deploy your site with the correct hosted backend.
j) Final Result
- Now your frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and fake backend (JSON Server) are both live!
- Your app can:
1) Create, read, update, and delete products.
2) Use pagination and display data dynamically.
