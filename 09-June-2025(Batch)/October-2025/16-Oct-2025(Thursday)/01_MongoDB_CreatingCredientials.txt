1) Go to MongoDB Atlas
- Open this website: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
- Click “Try Free” or “Sign In” if you already have an account.
2) Sign Up / Log In
- You can sign up using Google or Email.
- Once inside, you’ll see the MongoDB Atlas Dashboard.
3) Build a Cluster
- Click “Build a Database”.
- Choose the Free Shared option (starts with “M0 Free Tier”).
- Choose your Cloud Provider (AWS is fine) and a Region near you (like Mumbai if you’re in India).
- Click Create Deployment.
It takes a minute or two to set up.
4) Create Database Username & Password
a) After your cluster is created:
- Go to Security → Database Access (on the left menu).
- Click “Add New Database User”.
- Enter a username (e.g., adminuser).
- Enter a password (keep it safe!).(Can also generate password)
- Choose “Read and Write to Any Database”.

Keep this username & password — you’ll need them in the connection link.
5) Allow Network Access
a) To connect from your laptop:
- Go to Security → Network Access.
- Click “Add IP Address”.
- Choose:
Add Current IP Address (recommended),
OR 
use 0.0.0.0/0 (for access from anywhere — use only for testing).
- Click Confirm.
6) Get Your Connection Link (URI)
- Go to Database (left menu).
- Click “Connect” on your cluster.
- Choose “Connect your application”.
- Copy the connection string — it will look like this 👇
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcd123.mongodb.net/
Example:
mongodb+srv://adminuser:myPass123@cluster0.abcd123.mongodb.net/
