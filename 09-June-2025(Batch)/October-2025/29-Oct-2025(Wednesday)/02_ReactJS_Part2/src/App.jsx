/*
1) XML (Extensible Markup Language)
a) Meaning:
XML is a markup language used to store and share data in a structured and readable way.
b) Full Form:
Xtensible Markup Language
c) Purpose:

d) Example:
<student>
  <name>Shreya</name>
  <age>20</age>
  <course>Web Development</course>
</student>
e) Important Points:
- Uses tags (like HTML) — but tags are user-defined.
- Focuses on data, not on how it looks.
- Data is stored in a tree structure (parent–child form).
- Platform independent — works on any system.
- Easily readable for both humans and machines.
f) In short:
- XML is used to store, organize, and share data in a simple text format that both computers and humans can understand.
- HTML tags are predefined but XML tags are coustomize. JSX is using XML in JavaScript. In backend the XML code is converted in HTML and CSS. And website is rendered.
