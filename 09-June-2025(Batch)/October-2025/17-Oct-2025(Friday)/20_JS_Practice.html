    1) For form validation to work form tag and button with type submit is mandatory.

    2) text-align property works only on block level tags not on inline level tags.
    
    3) Advanced Selectors:
    a) div > p => Children Selector => Para1 and Para2
    b) div p => Descendant Selector => Para1, Para2 and Para3 => Children and GrandChildren
    c) Adjacent Sibling Selector => div + p => Direct Sibling => Para4
    d) Sibling Selectro => div ~ p => All siblings including adjacent => Para4 and Para5 
    <div>
        <p>Para1</p>
        <p>Para2</p>
        <section>
            <p>Para3</p>
        </section>
    </div>
    <p>Para4</p>
    <h1></h1>
    <p>Para5</p>
    
    4) offset:
    - Offset in CSS Grid means creating empty space (a gap) before a grid item basically, shifting the item to the right or down within the grid layout.
    - It’s like saying: “Start this box from column 2 instead of column 1.”
    
    5) In  carousel active class is important without it carousel will not be displayed.

    6) num1++ => Increse value by 1
    console.log(num1) => Print the incremented value
    | Expression | When it increases      | What `console.log` shows          |
    | ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | num1++     | After using the value  | Shows value after increase        |
    | ++num2     | Before using the value | Shows the already increased value |

    7) let num1 = 50
    console.log(typeof(typeof(num1)))
    - The first typeof tells us that num1 is a number.
    - The second typeof checks the type of the word “number”, which is a string.
    - So the output is "string"
