1) What is Pagination?
- Pagination means dividing content into multiple pages instead of showing everything at once.
- For example:
You have 100 products on a website.
You don’t want to show all 100 on one page — it’s too long!
So, you show 10 products per page → and create 10 pages.
This process = Pagination.
