<!-- 
1) What is Redux?
- Redux is a state manager for React. It stores data in one place so any component can use it. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
2) Redux Flow 
Component -> dispatch(Action) -> Reducer -> Store -> Component (useSelector)
---------------------------------------------------------------
3) a) Store
- A big container where all your app data (state) is kept.
- Created using createStore().
const store = createStore(rootReducer)

b) Action
- A message / instruction that tells WHAT to do.
- It has a type and sometimes data (payload).
const inc = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" })
const dec = () => ({ type: "DECREMENT" })
Actions do NOT change the data. They just tell the reducer what happened.

c) Reducer
- A function that actually changes the state.
- It listens to actions and updates the store.
- Reducer ≈ state-changing machine.
- A reducer is a function that receives two things:
a) state → current data
b) action → what to do (type + payload)
It returns the new updated state.
- Code:
const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, { type, payload }) => {
  if (type === "INCREMENT") {
    return { count: state.count + 1 }
  }
  if (type === "DECREMENT") {
    return { count: state.count - 1 }
  }
  return state
}
- What is happening here?
| Part                   | Meaning                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| state = { count: 0 }   | Default value when app starts |
| { type, payload }      | Action object destructured    |
| "INCREMENT"            | Increase the count by 1       |
| "DECREMENT"            | Decrease the count by 1       |
| return state           | If action unknown → no change |

d) rootReducer
- Combines all reducers into one.
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  todo: todoReducer
})
- This helps if you have multiple features.

e) Provider
- Connects the Redux store with React app.
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>

f) useDispatch()
- Used IN COMPONENT to send (dispatch) actions.
const dispatch = useDispatch()
dispatch(inc())

g) useSelector()
- Used IN COMPONENT to read data from the store.
const { count } = useSelector(state => state.counter)
- Here,
state = whole Redux store
state.counter = part managed by counterReducer

h) Short:
Component dispatches an Action → Reducer updates Store → useSelector reads data → UI updates

i) Short:
| Term        | Meaning                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Store       | Keeps the data          |
| Action      | What to change          |
| Reducer     | How to change           |
| Dispatch    | Send action to reducer  |
| useSelector | Get data from store     |
| Provider    | Connects Redux to React |
