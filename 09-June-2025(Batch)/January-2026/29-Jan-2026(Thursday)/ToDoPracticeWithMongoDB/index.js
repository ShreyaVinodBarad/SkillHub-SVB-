1) app.use() → tells Express to use something (middleware / routes)
2) "/api/todo" → base URL path

- All routes written inside todo.routes.js will start with /api/todo

📌 Middleware
- Middleware is a helper that works in between request and response.
- Think like this:
When a request comes to your app
Before it reaches your main code, middleware runs first.

📌 Postman
- Postman is an API testing tool that allows developers to send HTTP requests to backend APIs and verify responses without using a frontend.
- It is used to test, debug, and validate APIs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
