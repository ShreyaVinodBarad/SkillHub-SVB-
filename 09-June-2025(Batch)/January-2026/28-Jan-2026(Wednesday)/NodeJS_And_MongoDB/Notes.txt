npm init -y
👆 Automatically creates a package.json file with default settings.

npm i express
👆 Installs Express.js and adds it to your project’s dependencies.

npm i mongoose
👆 Installs Mongoose, a library used to connect Node.js with MongoDB and work with data using schemas and models.

📌 STEP-BY-STEP: HOW BACKEND WORKS
=> Server Start
1) You run:
nodemon index.js
2) index.js starts running (top to bottom)
3) Express and Mongoose are loaded
4) MongoDB connection starts
5) Express app is created
6) Middleware runs:
app.use(express.json())
7) Routes are registered:
app.use("/notes", todoRoutes)
8) MongoDB connects successfully
9) Server starts on port 5000
=> API Request Flow
10) Client sends request (Postman / Frontend)
11) Middleware reads JSON → req.body
12) Route matches (/notes/create)
13) Controller function runs
14) Model is called
15) MongoDB performs action (CRUD)
16) Response sent back to client

📌 Explained by Akash Sir
1) Index file runs first.
2) It finds that the route /notes is registered and goes to the route file.
3) In the route file, it checks which method (GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE) is used and, according to that method, it calls the function written in the route file.
4) That function is defined in the controller file.
5) The controller uses the Note model, which has the schema and validations.
6) If validation succeeds, the create function runs and the data from req.body is saved from backend to the database.
7) Finally, res.json() runs and sends the response back to the frontend.
