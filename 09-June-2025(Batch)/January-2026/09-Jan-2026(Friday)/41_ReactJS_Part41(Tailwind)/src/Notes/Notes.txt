1) Monolithic Application
a) Meaning:
- Everything is built together as ONE big application.
b) UI Example
- Imagine one single website/app where:
- Login page, Dashboard, Profile page, Payments page, all these screens are tightly connected and run as one unit
c) How UI works
One UI codebase
One build
One deployment
- If you change one button color, the whole app needs to be rebuilt and deployed
d) Pros (UI side)
- Easy to build initially
- Simple for small projects
e) Cons (UI side)
- UI becomes heavy
- Hard to scale
- One UI bug can break entire app
- Slow updates
---------------------------------------------------------
2) Microservices Application 
a) Meaning:
- Application is broken into many small independent parts.
b) UI Example
- Same app, but split:
Login UI → Team A
Dashboard UI → Team B
Payments UI → Team C
- Each UI part is separate
c) How UI works
- Multiple small UI apps
- Each has its own build & deploy
- One UI can update without touching others
d) Pros (UI side)
- Faster UI updates
- Teams work independently
- Easy to scale
- Safer changes
e) Cons (UI side)
- More setup
- Needs good coordination
---------------------------------------------------------
3) Module Federation 
a) Meaning (easy):
- Different UI apps share and load parts of UI from each other at runtime.
- It is mainly used with Microservices in frontend
b) UI Example
- Main App (Shell):
Header, Sidebar
- Other Apps:
Dashboard (from another project)
Profile (from another project)
Payments (from another project)
- Main app fetches UI pieces dynamically
c) How UI works
Header UI from App A
Dashboard UI from App B
Payments UI from App C
- All appear like one single app to the user 
---------------------------------------------------------
4) Install Tailwind CSS in React (Vite)
a) Create a React app using Vite (if not already created)
npm create vite@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
b) Go to Tailwind CSS website
- Open tailwindcss.com
- Click Get Started
- Select Framework Guides
- Choose Vite
c) Install Tailwind CSS
- Run this command in your project terminal:
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
- This installs Tailwind and the Vite plugin.
d) Configure vite.config.js
- Open vite.config.js and update it with this:
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss()
    👆 Add this
  ],
})
- Meaning:
tailwindcss() tells Vite to use Tailwind while building your app.
e) Add Tailwind to CSS file
- Open src/index.css and paste this line:
@import "tailwindcss";
- This loads all Tailwind utility classes.
f) Use Tailwind in your app
- Open src/App.jsx and test it:
function App() {
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">
      Tailwind CSS is working.
    </h1>
  )
}
export default App
g) Run the project
npm run dev
📌 Summary
- Install Tailwind → npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
- Add plugin in vite.config.js
- Import Tailwind in index.css
- Run → npm run dev
