        20 Jan 25 - Box Model
    </title>
    <!--  
    What is CSS Box Model?
    ==> The CSS Box Model is a way of describing how elements on a webpage are structured. Each element is treated as a box that consists of four parts:
    1. Content:- 
    - The actual text or image inside the element.
    2. Padding:- 
    - The space between the content and the border, providing extra room inside the box.
    3. Border:- 
    - The line surrounding the padding and content, which can have width, color, and style.
    4. Margin:- 
    - The outermost space around the border, creating distance between the element and other elements.
    ==> Together, these parts determine the overall size and positioning of an element on a page.
