        20 Jan 25 - CSS Background Image
    </title>
    <!--  
    What is CSS background-image Property?
    The CSS background-image property is used to set an image as the background of an element, like a webpage, button, or box. Instead of a solid color, it allows you to display a picture, pattern, or gradient behind the content of that element.

    <style>
        h1{
            color: brown;
            background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5);
            /*  
            ðŸ‘†
            With background-image Property we use background-color in rgba Format wherein we keep a value i.e. Alpha 0 for full Transparency or 0.5 for just See - through!
            */
            /*  
            Here in rgba a is known as Alpha which is used for Transparency!
            Whose range is from 0 to 1.
            1) 0
            ==> Here 0 means Completely Transparent means you can see through it fully, like glass!
            2) 0.5
            ==> Here 0.5 means it's 50% see-through.
            3) 1
            ==> Here 1 means Completely opaque means not see-through at all. You cannot see anything behind the colorâ€”it fully covers what's underneath.
            The 1 means it is fully solid with no transparency.
