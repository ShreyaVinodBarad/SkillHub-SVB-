            Whose range is from 1 to 0.
            1) 0
            ==> Here 0 means Completely Transparent means you can see through it fully, like glass!
            2) 0.5
            ==> Here 0.5 means it's 50% see-through.
            3) 1
            ==> Here 1 means Completely opaque means not see-through at all. You cannot see anything behind the colorâ€”it fully covers what's underneath.
            The 1 means it is fully solid with no transparency.
