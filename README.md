Hi there! This is Shreya. I joined SkillHub, which is owned and operated by Akash Sir, on Wednesday, January 15, 2025.
I'm going to provide a brief update on what I've learned each day here. 👍
Let's get started! 😉

--> January 15, 2025, Wednesday
I met my Sir on my first day at the Institute! who, despite failing three times in 12th grade, never gave up, completed his graduation and post-graduation with honors, and then created an internship application where he discovered that the knowledge he had gained in just six months had not even been covered in his six years of graduation and post-graduation education!
According to his statement, there are three things occurring in every college across India:-
1) Attendance
2) Assignments
3) Examinations
   Expect EDUCATION 😢
According to him, you need to have knowledge in your chosen field in order to enter the industry.
- When it came to the course computer setup, he stated that VS Code is the code editor that is required for coding. Next came all of VS Code's shortcuts, which make our jobs easier when we have to write more than 100 lines of code.
- He then gave a lesson on web development! What is it? its three main components: the database, frontend, and backend. mentioned the languages that will be used in the frontend. Additionally, databases must be employed, and server-side languages are used to link the frontend and backend when transferring data.
- Additionally, he provided a brief overview of tags and heading tags!
- He created a one-month goal 🎯 for our group and assigned homework, which consists of things that we need to review and return to the following day!
  That concludes today! 🤞

We then dug into the subject of Form Validation.
After that, we reviewed the Validation Attributes of the Form.
1) Validation Attributes for text type are

3) Validation Attributes for date type are:-
        - min ==> Year - Month - Date

4) Placeholder Attribute:- 
        Shows some random hint of what to be filled in the input
5) value Attribute:- 
        This will be the default text in the input field and when we write some text it gets continue to write with the text present in it!
6) The button Tag is always in the input type as submit because of which when we click on it, gives some action!

==> Finally, we wrapped up our session by discussing the concept of navigation, or how to move between web pages while our files are stored in different folders.
This is accomplished by providing the right file location in the href attribute of the Anchor Tag!
