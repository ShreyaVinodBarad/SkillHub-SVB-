Hi there! This is Shreya. I joined SkillHub, which is owned and operated by Akash Sir, on Wednesday, January 15, 2025.
I'm going to provide a brief update on what I've learned each day here. 👍
Let's get started! 😉
---------------------

--> January 15, 2025, Wednesday

==> I met my Sir on my first day at the Institute! who, despite failing three times in 12th grade, never gave up, completed his graduation and post-graduation with honors, and then created an internship application where he discovered that the knowledge he had gained in just six months had not even been covered in his six years of graduation and post-graduation education!

==> According to his statement, there are three things occurring in every college across India:-
1) Attendance
2) Assignments
3) Examinations
   Expect EDUCATION 😢
   According to him, you need to have knowledge in your chosen field in order to enter the industry.

==> When it came to the course computer setup, he stated that VS Code is the code editor that is required for coding. Next came all of VS Code's shortcuts, which make our jobs easier when we have to write more than 100 lines of code.

==> He then gave a lesson on web development! What is it? its three main components: the database, frontend, and backend. mentioned the languages that will be used in the frontend. Additionally, databases must be employed, and server-side languages are used to link the frontend and backend when transferring data.

==> Additionally, he provided a brief overview of tags and heading tags!
==> He created a one-month goal 🎯 for our group and assigned homework, which consists of things that we need to review and return to the following day!
  That concludes today! 🤞

--> 18 Jan 2025, Saturday

==> Sir began today's lesson with a few questions that we, the students, were to respond to!
We then dug into the subject of Form Validation.

==> After that, we reviewed the Validation Attributes of the Form.
1) Validation Attributes for text type are
- required
- minlength
- maxlength

2) Validation Attributes for number type are:-
   - min ==> Here we have to take number above the given min value.
   - max ==> Here it will take numbers below the given max value

3) Validation Attributes for date type are:-
   - min ==> Year - Month - Date
   - max ==> Year - Month - Date

     👆
     Way of writing the date's Attribute Format!

   👆
   Way of writing the date's Attribute Format!

4) Placeholder Attribute:-
   Shows some random hint of what to be filled in the input

5) value Attribute:-
   This will be the default text in the input field and when we write some text it gets continue to write with the text present in it!

6) The button Tag is always in the input type as submit because of which when we click on it, gives some action!

7) As the name Specifies it Resets the while Form!

8) action Attribute:-
   action Attribute of form Tag is responsible of sending data to Database!

   ==> Next, we learned what Block and Inline level Tags are and a few of their HTML tags!. We began by discussing how to create a folder and a file simultaneously in Visual Studio Code.

   ==> Finally, we wrapped up our session by discussing the concept of navigation, or how to move between web pages while our files are stored in different folders.
   This is accomplished by providing the right file location in the href attribute of the Anchor Tag!

   ==> Homework:
   According to Sir, he will begin CSS the following week!
   Very excited! 🤞

--> 20 Jan 2025, Monday

==> Our lesson on file paths in HTML began today! where I learned about HTML's relative and absolute file paths.
Learning this topic was fascinating and enjoyable because it required us to construct HTML code that used the Anchor Tag to go from one page to another, using the Path to href attribute.
When developing code, we must mostly use the Relative File Path in the href attribute!
Additionally, the backend primarily uses Abosolute File Path!

==> Then Sir, Revised some HTML Topics!

==> Next, Sir begin with CSS i.e., Cascading Style Sheets.
Wherein the CSS Topics covered are:-

1. CSS Basics: -

==> Wherein here we have understood CSS Syntax with each of it's Technical Terms.
==> Example of CSS Syntax:-

h1{
color: brown;
}

|  h1  |    Selector    |
| :---: | :------------: |
|  {}  | Curly Brackets |
| color |    Property    |
|   :   |     Colon     |
|   ;   |   Semi Colon   |

==> We use style Tag to write CSS in HTML File!

2) CSS Box Model :-

==>Border, Padding and Margin all together is known as Box Model!

==> The CSS Box Model is a way of describing how elements on a webpage are structured. Each element is treated as a box that consists of four parts:
a. Content:-

==> The actual text or image inside the element.
b. Padding:-

==> The space between the content and the border, providing extra room inside the box.
c. Border:-

==> The line surrounding the padding and content, which can have width, color, and style.
d. Margin:-

==> The outermost space around the border, creating distance between the element and other elements.

==> Together, these parts determine the overall size and positioning of an element on a page.

1) CSS Border:-

   ==> A CSS border is the outer frame of an element. You can change its style, thickness, and color to make elements stand out or look defined.

   ==> Wherein we have seen "border-style" Property which has values that are

| solid  |
| ------ |
| dotted |
| dashed |
| double |
| groove |
| ridge  |

 ==> Then you can take border on only one side as per your wish by using one of these property:-

- border-top
- border-bottom
- border-left
- border-right

  ==> Border CSS using Shorthand Method:-

- border: border-width border-style border-color;

2) CSS Margin:-

   ==> CSS margin is the space outside the border of an element, creating distance between it and other elements.

    ==> If we use only Margin Porperty then the Margin will apply on 4 sides of the Box!
   But we also have option  of applying Margin to one side of the box!
   I.e.,:-

- margin-top
- margin-bottom
- margin-left
- margin-right

  ==> But we can write Margin by grouping the sides accroding to our requirement!

- margin: 50px 500px 200px;

  | 50px  | Top        |
  | ----- | ---------- |
  | 500px | Right Left |
  | 200px | Bottom     |

- margin: 50px 500px;

  | 50px  | Top Bottom |
  | ----- | ---------- |
  | 500px | Right Left |

- margin: 50px 50px 300px 50px;

  | 50px  | Top    |
  | ----- | ------ |
  | 50px  | Right  |
  | 300px | Bottom |
  | 50px  | Left   |

  ==> It just goes Clockwise Top, Right, Bottom, and Left.

3) CSS Padding:-

   ==> CSS padding is the space between the content of an element ,like text or an image and its border.
   It creates breathing room inside the element, making the content not touch the edges. Padding can be applied to all  sides like ; top, right, bottom, left to control how much space you want around the content.

   ==> If we use only padding Porperty then the Padding will apply on 4 sides of the Box!
   But we also have option  of applying Padding to one side of the box!
   I.e.,:-

- padding - top
- padding - bottom
- padding - left
- padding - right

  ==> But we can write Padding by grouping the sides accroding to our requirement!

- padding: 50px 500px 200px;

| 50px  | Top        |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 500px | Right Left |
| 200px | Bottom     |

- padding: 50px 500px;

| 50px  | Top Bottom |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 500px | Right Left |

- padding: 50px 50px 300px 50px;

| 50px  | Top    |
| ----- | ------ |
| 50px  | Right  |
| 300px | Bottom |
| 50px  | Left   |

It just goes Clockwise Top, Right, Bottom, and Left.

4) CSS background-color Property:-

   ==> The background-color property in CSS changes the color behind an element, like a box or a section. It makes the element stand out or match the design of the page. You can pick any color using names, hex codes, or other color values.
5) CSS background-image Property:-

   ==> The CSS `background-image` property is used to set an image as the background of an element, like a webpage, button, or box. Instead of a solid color, it allows you to display a picture, pattern, or gradient behind the content of that element.

   ==> With background-image Property we use background-color in rgba Format wherein we keep a value i.e. Alpha 0 for full Transparency or 0.5 for just See - through!

   background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5);
Here in rgba a is known as Alpha which is used for Transparency!
Whose range is from 0 to 1.

a) 0
==> Here 0 means Completely Transparent means you can see through it fully, like glass!

b) 0.5
==> Here 0.5 means it's 50% see-through.

c) 1
==> Here 1 means Completely opaque means not see-through at all. You cannot see anything behind the color—it fully covers what's underneath. The 1 means it is fully solid with no transparency.

6) CSS Color:-

==> background-color: red;
👆 Known as Solid Colors!

==> background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);
👆

| r | Red             |
| - | --------------- |
| g | **Green** |
| b | **Blue**  |

==> The Range of rgb is from 0 - 255!
==> The session was finally concluded by Akash Sir, who gave us some homework!
I.e., to go through certain Topics they are:-

| text-transform |
| -------------- |
| text-align     |
| height         |
| width          |
| Flex Box       |
| border-radius  |

Here I am at the conclusion of my day at SkillHub!

Can not wait to find out more tomorrow!✍
