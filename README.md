Hi there! This is Shreya. I joined SkillHub, which is owned and operated by Akash Sir, on Wednesday, January 15, 2025.
I'm going to provide a brief update on what I've learned each day here. 👍
Let's get started! 😉
---------------------

---

### January 15, 2025, Wednesday

==> I met my Sir on my first day at the Institute! who, despite failing three times in 12th grade, never gave up, completed his graduation and post-graduation with honors, and then created an internship application where he discovered that the knowledge he had gained in just six months had not even been covered in his six years of graduation and post-graduation education!

==> According to his statement, there are three things occurring in every college across India:-

1) Attendance
2) Assignments
3) Examinations
   Expect EDUCATION 😢
   According to him, you need to have knowledge in your chosen field in order to enter the industry.

==> When it came to the course computer setup, he stated that VS Code is the code editor that is required for coding. Next came all of VS Code's shortcuts, which make our jobs easier when we have to write more than 100 lines of code.

==> He then gave a lesson on web development! What is it? its three main components: the database, frontend, and backend. mentioned the languages that will be used in the frontend. Additionally, databases must be employed, and server-side languages are used to link the frontend and backend when transferring data.

==> Additionally, he provided a brief overview of tags and heading tags!

==> He created a one-month goal 🎯 for our group and assigned homework, which consists of things that we need to review and return to the following day!
  That concludes today! 🤞

---

### 16 Jan 2025, Thursday

==> First, Sir began by reviewing the VS Code shortcuts and then provided a few additional.

==> He then went on to describe a few HTML topics, which include:

1. Heading Tags
2. Tag for the table
3. The image tag
4. HTML Lists
5. Anchor Tag

==> Lastly, Sir assigned us homework, which consists of items we need to review at home before attending class the next day! 👍

---

### 17 Jan 2025, Friday

==> Sir took the lesson today, claiming to have finished all of the HTML!
He began by giving us a job in which he explained some additional table tag features, such as colspan and rowspan.

We then completed a few tasks related to it and concluded the table tag topic.

==> Sir then discussed a few topics, which included:

1. ***HTML Forms***

- input Tag
- textarea Tag
- Dropdown Menu
- Radio Button
- CheckBox
- Upload File from PC
- Select Date
- Pick Color
- Enter Password
- input Area for only Number!
- Select Time
- Select Range
- button Tag
- Button's using input Tag
- Line Break Tag `<br>`

2. ***How to view YouTube video on Our Web Page?***
3. ***How to view Google Map on our Web Page?***

==> At last, he did not assign homework for today! 😎

However, stated that CSS would begin tomorrow, Saturday, January 18, 2025!🤞

---

### 18 Jan 2025, Saturday

==> Sir began today's lesson with a few questions that we, the students, were to respond to!
We then dug into the subject of Form Validation.

==> After that, we reviewed the ***Validation Attributes of the Form***.

1) Validation Attributes for text type are

- required
- minlength
- maxlength

2) Validation Attributes for number type are:-

   - min ==> Here we have to take number above the given min value.
   - max ==> Here it will take numbers below the given max value
3) Validation Attributes for date type are:-

   - min ==> Year - Month - Date
   - max ==> Year - Month - Date

     👆
     Way of writing the date's Attribute Format!
4) Placeholder Attribute:-
   => Shows some random hint of what to be filled in the input
5) value Attribute:-
   => This will be the default text in the input field and when we write some text it gets continue to write with the text present in it!
6) The button Tag is always in the input type as submit because of which when we click on it, gives some action!
7) As the name Specifies it Resets the while Form!
8) action Attribute:-
   => action Attribute of form Tag is responsible of sending data to Database!

   ==> Next, we learned what Block and Inline level Tags are and a few of their HTML tags!. We began by discussing how to create a folder and a file simultaneously in Visual Studio Code.

   ==> Finally, we wrapped up our session by discussing the concept of navigation, or how to move between web pages while our files are stored in different folders.
   This is accomplished by providing the right file location in the href attribute of the Anchor Tag!

   ***==> Homework:***
   According to Sir, he will begin CSS the following week!
   Very excited! 🤞

---

### 20 Jan 2025, Monday

==> Our lesson on file paths in HTML began today! where I learned about HTML's relative and absolute file paths.

==> Learning this topic was fascinating and enjoyable because it required us to construct HTML code that used the Anchor Tag to go from one page to another, using the Path to href attribute.

==> When developing code, we must mostly use the Relative File Path in the href attribute!
Additionally, the backend primarily uses Abosolute File Path!

==> Then Sir, Revised some HTML Topics!

==> Next, Sir begin with ***CSS i.e., Cascading Style Sheets***.
Wherein the CSS Topics covered are:-

1. ***CSS Basics***: -

==> Wherein here we have understood CSS Syntax with each of it's Technical Terms.
==> Example of CSS Syntax:-

h1{
color: brown;
}

|  h1  |    Selector    |
| :---: | :------------: |
|  {}  | Curly Brackets |
| color |    Property    |
|   :   |     Colon     |
|   ;   |   Semi Colon   |

==> We use style Tag to write CSS in HTML File!

2) ***CSS Box Model*** :-

==>Border, Padding and Margin all together is known as Box Model!

==> The CSS Box Model is a way of describing how elements on a webpage are structured. Each element is treated as a box that consists of four parts:

| 1 | Content |                             The actual text or image inside the element.                             |
| - | ------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 2 | Padding |        The space between the content and the border, providing extra<br />room inside the box.        |
| 3 | Border  |      The line surrounding the padding and content, which can have<br />width, color, and style.      |
| 4 | Margin  | The outermost space around the border, creating distance between<br />the element and other elements. |

==> Together, these parts determine the overall size and positioning of an element on a page.

1) *CSS Border*:-

   ==> A CSS border is the outer frame of an element. You can change its style, thickness, and color to make elements stand out or look defined.

   ==> Wherein we have seen "border-style" Property which has values that are

| solid  |
| ------ |
| dotted |
| dashed |
| double |
| groove |
| ridge  |

 ==> Then you can take border on only one side as per your wish by using one of these property:-

|  border-top  |
| :-----------: |
| border-bottom |
|  border-left  |
| border-right |

==> Border CSS using Shorthand Method:-

| border: border-width border-style border-color; |
| ----------------------------------------------- |

2. *CSS Margin*:-

==> CSS margin is the space outside the border of an element, creating distance between it and other elements.

==> If we use only Margin Porperty then the Margin will apply on 4 sides of the Box!
But we also have option  of applying Margin to one side of the box!
I.e.,:-

|  margin-top  |
| :-----------: |
| margin-bottom |
|  margin-left  |
| margin-right |

==> But we can write Margin by grouping the sides accroding to our requirement!

**margin: 50px 500px 200px;**

| 50px  | Top        |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 500px | Right Left |
| 200px | Bottom     |

**margin: 50px 500px;**

| 50px  | Top Bottom |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 500px | Right Left |

**margin: 50px 50px 300px 50px;**

| 50px  | Top    |
| ----- | ------ |
| 50px  | Right  |
| 300px | Bottom |
| 50px  | Left   |

==> It just goes Clockwise Top, Right, Bottom, and Left.

3) *CSS Padding*:-

   ==> CSS padding is the space between the content of an element ,like text or an image and its border.
   It creates breathing room inside the element, making the content not touch the edges. Padding can be applied to all  sides like ; top, right, bottom, left to control how much space you want around the content.

   ==> If we use only padding Porperty then the Padding will apply on 4 sides of the Box!
   But we also have option  of applying Padding to one side of the box!
   I.e.,:-

|  padding-top  |
| :------------: |
| padding-bottom |
|  padding-left  |
| padding-right |

==> But we can write Padding by grouping the sides accroding to our requirement!

**padding: 50px 500px 200px;**

| 50px  | Top        |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 500px | Right Left |
| 200px | Bottom     |

**padding: 50px 500px;**

| 50px  | Top Bottom |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 500px | Right Left |

**padding: 50px 50px 300px 50px;**

| 50px  | Top    |
| ----- | ------ |
| 50px  | Right  |
| 300px | Bottom |
| 50px  | Left   |

It just goes Clockwise Top, Right, Bottom, and Left.

***3. CSS background-color Property***:-

==> The background-color property in CSS changes the color behind an element, like a box or a section. It makes the element stand out or match the design of the page. You can pick any color using names, hex codes, or other color values.

***4. CSS background-image Property***:-

==> The CSS `background-image` property is used to set an image as the background of an element, like a webpage, button, or box. Instead of a solid color, it allows you to display a picture, pattern, or gradient behind the content of that element.

==> With background-image Property we use background-color in rgba Format wherein we keep a value i.e. Alpha 0 for full Transparency or 0.5 for just See - through!

| background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5); |
| ------------------------------------ |

==> Here in rgba a is known as Alpha which is used for Transparency!
Whose range is from 0 to 1.

| Range |                                                                                                 Meaning                                                                                                 |
| :---: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   0   |                                                         Here 0 means Completely Transparent means you can see through it fully,<br />like glass!                                                         |
|  0.5  |                                                                                   Here 0.5 means it's 50% see-through.                                                                                   |
|   1   | Here 1 means Completely opaque means not see-through at all.<br />You cannot see anything behind the color—it fully covers what's <br />underneath. The 1 means it is fully solid with no transparency. |

5. ***CSS Color:***-

==> background-color: red;
👆 Known as Solid Colors!

==> background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);
👆

| r | Red             |
| - | --------------- |
| g | **Green** |
| b | **Blue**  |

==> The Range of rgb is from 0 - 255!
==> The session was finally concluded by Akash Sir, who gave us some homework!
I.e., to go through certain Topics they are:-

| text-transform |
| -------------- |
| text-align     |
| height         |
| width          |
| Flex Box       |
| border-radius  |

Here I am at the conclusion of my day at SkillHub!

Can not wait to find out more tomorrow!✍

### 21 Jan 2025, Tuesday

***1) Started with 20 Jan 2025 Homework:-***

=> Firstly, I have started by completing 20 Jan 2025 i.e; Monday's Homework, which was Successfully Done by me!✍


***2)  Colors Hex Code:-***

=> Then at SkillHub Akash Sir, has begun our class by Colors Hex code! Wherein we have learned it's Format that was "#RRGGBB".

=> Examples:-


| Sr.No | Hex Code Format | Color |
| :---: | :-------------: | ----- |
|   1   |     #FF0000     | Red   |
|   2   |     #00FF00     | Green |
|   3   |     #0000FF     | Blue  |
|   4   |     #000000     | Black |
|   5   |     #FFFFFF     | White |

***3) Then we learned height and width Property in CSS!***                                                                    

*1) width:-*

=> This sets the exact width of an element.

=> For example:-


width: 300px; makes an element 300 pixels wide.

=> It doesn’t adjust based on the screen size or content.

*2) max-width:-*

=> This sets the maximum width an element can have.

=> For example:-

max-width: 500px; means the element will never be wider than 500 pixels, but it can shrink if needed to fit smaller screens or content.

=> Key Difference:-                                                                                                                            

width is fixed, while max-width allows flexibility by capping the size.

*3) height:-*

=> The height property in CSS is used to set how tall an element is. It controls the vertical space an element takes up.

***4) Then next, we came to div Tag;***                                                                                                                     

=> The  tag in HTML is a container used to group content together. It doesn't have any specific styling or meaning on its own.

=> Instead, you use it along with CSS to style or organize sections of a
webpage.


=> For example, you can use a  to:

1) Apply styles (like colors, borders, or layouts) to a group of elements.

2. Divide a webpage into sections, like header, main content, or
   footer.

Think of  as a blank box you can customize with CSS.

***5) CSS Icons:-***

==> *Proceducre to Use Bootstrap Icons*:-                                              				

1) First go to Bootstrap Website.

2) Then click on Icons.

3) Go down of the Icons Web Page.

4) Go to Install Option and You will get CDN Option there you will get a link copy that and paste it into Tag.

5) Then you can select which ever Icon you want and copy it's Tag, which also contains a class from - bootstrap-icons.min.css.

6) You can modify your Icon by providing CSS to another class and
then providing that class to class attribute of the Tag!

***6) CSS Selectors:-***

==>*What are Selectors in CSS?*

Selectors in CSS are like Instructions that tell the browser which parts of a webpage to change. They help you choose specific elements (like text, buttons, or images) and apply styles to them.

=> For example:- 

    1. If you want to change all paragraphs, you use a selector for paragraphs.

2. If you want to change just a specific button, you use a selector for that button.

=> Think of selectors as a way to point to the exact parts of a webpage and tell the browser how they should look!													

==> *Types of CSS Selectors:-*

1)*Universal Selector (*):-

=> Targets all elements on a page.

=> Example:-
*{
color: red;																}																

=> makes all text red.

*2) Type Selector (Element Selector)*:-
=> Targets elements by their tag name.

=> Example:-
p{
font-size: 16px;
}

=> styles all  tags.

*3) Class Selector (.):-*

=> Targets elements with a specific class attribute.

=> Example:-
.button{
padding: 10px;
}

=> styles all elements with the class button.																				

*4) ID Selector (#):-*


=> Targets an element with a specific id attribute (unique per page).


=> Example:-
#header{
background-color: blue;
}


=> styles the element with id header.

***7) CSS Specificity:***-														

==> *What is CSS Specificity?*	

CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. It works by giving a weight to different types of selectors:-

*1) Inline styles:-*


=> Example:-


| style='color: red;' | have the highest specificity |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |

*2) IDs:-*


=> Example:-


| #header | have the 2nd highest Specificity |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |

*3) Class's:-*


=> Example:-


| .Test | have the 3rd highest Specificity |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |


*4) Element or Tag Selector:-*

=> Example:-


| h1 | have the 4th or lowest Specificity |
| -- | ---------------------------------- |



==> The more specific a selector is, the higher its weight and the more likely it is to apply the style.


==> If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS will be applied.

***8) CSS text-align Property:-***

==> Aligns the Text according to the given value to the text-align Property.  

==>*Examples:-*


| Sr.No | Syntax              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

***9) CSS text-decoration Property:-***

==>*What is text-decoration*?


=> text-decoration in CSS is a property used to style the appearance of text. It can add effects like underlines, strikethroughs, or overlines.

| 4     | text-decoration: none;         | Removes any decoration -<br />like underlines or lines.  |

***10) CSS text-Transform:-***	

*==>* *What is text-transform Property in CSS?*                                                               

=> text-transform in CSS is a property that changes the case of text. You can use it to make text uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the first letter of each word.                                      

=> *Example:*-


| Sr.No | Syntax                      | Meaning                                                |

***11) Ways of Applying CSS:-***                                                                                  									

==> Ways to Apply CSS are:-

1) Internal CSS

2) External CSS

3) Inline CSS

==> Among the Ways to Apply CSS which will Apply to the Web Page is based on Sequence!

==> *Which one applies first (CSS Priority)?*                                    				

*1)* Inline CSS has the highest priority.

2) Internal CSS comes next.

3) External CSS has the lowest priority.

==> *Example :-*
If all three styles apply to the same element, the inline style will take effect.

==> *What is !important which is applied in CSS's Property's value?*

=> In CSS, !important is a rule added to a property value to make sure it overrides any other styles, no matter where they come from (inline, internal, or external stylesheets).

=> *Example:-*

p {
	color: red !important;
}

p {
	color: blue;
}

=> In this case, the paragraph will be red because - !important gives
that rule the highest priority.

**12) HomeWork:-** 

==> Homework for 21 Jan 2025 was:-
