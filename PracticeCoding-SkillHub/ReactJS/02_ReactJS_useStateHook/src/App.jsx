/*
1) XML (Extensible Markup Language)
a) Meaning:
- XML is a markup language used to store and share data in a structured and readable way.
b) Full Form:
- Xtensible Markup Language
c) Purpose:
- It helps in transferring data between programs, websites, and databases in a standard format.
d) Example:
<student>
  <name>Shreya</name>
  <age>20</age>
  <course>Web Development</course>
</student>
e) Important Points:
- Uses tags (like HTML) — but tags are user-defined.
- Focuses on data, not on how it looks.
- Data is stored in a tree structure (parent–child form).
- Platform independent — works on any system.
- Easily readable for both humans and machines.
f) In short:
- XML is used to store, organize, and share data in a simple text format that both computers and humans can understand.
- HTML tags are predefined but XML tags are coustomize. JSX is using XML in JavaScript. In backend the XML code is converted in HTML and CSS. And website is rendered.

2) Objects are not valid as a React child
