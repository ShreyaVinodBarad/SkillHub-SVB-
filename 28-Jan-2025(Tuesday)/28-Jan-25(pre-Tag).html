    c) Useful for Code Display:- 
    - It is commonly used to display code snippets, ASCII art, or text that requires precise formatting.
    => When to Use <pre>:-
    - Displaying code blocks (often combined with <code>).
    - Showing structured text, like poetry or ASCII art.
    - Displaying logs or tabular data that must maintain spacing.
