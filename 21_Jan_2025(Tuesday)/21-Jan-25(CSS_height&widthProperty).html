    What is width and max-width Property in CSS?
    ==> In CSS:
    1) width:-
    => This sets the exact width of an element. 
    => For example:- 
    width: 300px; makes an element 300 pixels wide. It doesnâ€™t adjust based on the screen size or content.
    2) max-width:-  
    => This sets the maximum width an element can have. 
    => For example:- 
    max-width: 500px; means the element will never be wider than 500 pixels, but it can shrink if needed to fit smaller screens or content.
    3) Key Difference:-  
    => width is fixed, while max-width allows flexibility by capping the size.

    What is <div> Tag in CSS?
    ==> The <div> tag in HTML is a container used to group content together. It doesn't have any specific styling or meaning on its own. Instead, you use it along with CSS to style or organize sections of a webpage. 
    ==> For example, you can use a <div> to:
    1) Apply styles (like colors, borders, or layouts) to a group of elements.
    2) Divide a webpage into sections, like header, main content, or footer.
    ==> Think of <div> as a blank box you can customize with CSS.
