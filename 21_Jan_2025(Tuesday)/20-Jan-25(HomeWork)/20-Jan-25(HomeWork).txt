3) What is height in CSS?
==> In CSS, height is a property used to set how tall an element is. 
==> It defines the vertical space an element takes up. 
==> You can use values like:
1) Pixels (px):-
- Eg => height: 200px;
2) Percentages (%):-
-Eg => height: 50%; 
(relative to the parent element's height)
3) Auto:- 
- Lets the browser calculate the height automatically based on the content.
4) Viewport units (vh):- 
- Eg => height: 50vh; 
(relative to the height of the screen).
==> If no height is set, the element's height adjusts automatically to fit its content.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
4) What is Width in CSS?
==> In CSS, width is a property used to set how wide an element should be. 
==> It defines the horizontal space an element will take up, excluding padding, borders, and margins. 
==> You can set it in units like pixels (px), percentages (%), or other values (e.g., em(element-is a relative unit of measurement),rem(root em), vw(Viewport width)).
==> Example:- 
width: 200px; 
(makes an element 200 pixels wide.)
==> If not set, an element’s width often depends on its content or parent container.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
5) What is Flex Box in CSS?
==> Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout system that makes it easy to arrange and align items within a container.
==> It helps create flexible and responsive designs without needing complex code.
==> Key points about flexbox:  
1) Parent container:-
Set display: flex; on a container to use flexbox.  
2) Alignment:- 
Items can be easily aligned horizontally (justify-content) and vertically (align-items).  
3) Direction:-
Items can be arranged in rows or columns (flex-direction).  
4) Spacing:- 
Adjust the space between, around, or within items.  
5) Flexibility:- 
Items can grow, shrink, or stay fixed based on available space (flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis).
==> Example:-  
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Aligns items horizontally */
  align-items: center;    /* Aligns items vertically */
}
==> This makes it great for building modern, responsive layouts!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
6) What is border-radius in CSS?
==> The border-radius property in CSS is used to make the corners of an element rounded. 
==> You can control how round the corners are by setting values like pixels (px), percentages (%), or other units.
==> Examples:-
1) border-radius: 10px; 
Makes the corners slightly rounded.
2) border-radius: 50%; 
Makes the element look like a circle (if it's a square). 
==> It applies to borders, background, and content within the element.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
7) What is the purpose of DOCTYPE in HTML?
==> The DOCTYPE in HTML tells the web browser what version of HTML the page is written in. 
==> I.e.;
<!DOCTYPE html>
==> It indicates the page uses HTML5.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
8) What is Semantic in HTML?
==> Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in the content. 
==> Instead of using generic elements like <div> or <span>, semantic tags such as <article>, <section>, <header>, and <footer> give more meaning to the structure of a webpage. 
==> This makes the content easier to read and understand for both humans and search engines, improving accessibility and SEO. ==> For example, instead of using a <div> to create a navigation bar, you would use <nav>, which specifically indicates that the section is for navigation links.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
9) What is difference between div element and span element?
==> The main difference between the <div> and <span> elements is how they behave in a webpage layout:
1) <div>:- 
It's a block-level element. This means it takes up the whole width of its container and pushes other elements below it. It's used to group content and create sections on the page.
2) <span>:-  
It's an inline element. This means it only takes up as much width as its content and doesn't push other elements down. It's used to style small pieces of content within a line, like a word or a phrase.
==> So, use <div> when you want to create sections or large groupings, and use <span> when you need to style or target small parts of text within a block.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
10) What is the difference between <b> and <strong> tags in HTML?
==> The <b> and <strong> tags in HTML both make text bold, but they are used for different purposes:-
1) <b>:- 
This is just for styling. It makes text bold without adding any special meaning. It’s purely for visual appearance.
2) <strong>:- 
This also makes text bold, but it has a special meaning. It indicates that the text is important or has strong emphasis. It’s used for accessibility and SEO, signaling that the text carries more weight or significance.
==> So, use <b> for simple bolding and <strong> when the text is important or needs to stand out for meaning.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
11) What is the purpose of the alt attribute in HTML?
==> The alt attribute in HTML is used to provide a text description for images. 
==> This helps people who cannot see the image, like those using screen readers, to understand what the image is about. It also shows up if the image fails to load. 
For example:-
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A cute brown dog playing in the park">
==> In this case, if the image can't load, the text "A cute brown dog playing in the park" will appear instead.
