1) Difference between <ol>, <ul>, and <li>?
- The difference between <ol>, <ul>, and <li> is:
a) <ol> stands for ordered list. It shows a list with numbers (1, 2, 3...).
b) <ul> stands for unordered list. It shows a list with bullet points (•).
c) <li> stands for list item. It is used inside <ol> or <ul> to define each item in the list.
- In short:
a) Use <ol> when the order matters (like steps).
b) Use <ul> when the order doesn’t matter (like a shopping list).
c) Use <li> for each item in the list.
