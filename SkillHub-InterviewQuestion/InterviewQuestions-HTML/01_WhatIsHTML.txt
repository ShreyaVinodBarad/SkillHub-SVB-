1) What is HTML?
- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the basic language used to create webpages.
- It tells the web browser what to show and how to show it.
- For example, we use HTML to add headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content to a website.
- Think of it like the skeleton of a webpage â€“ it gives structure to everything you see online.
