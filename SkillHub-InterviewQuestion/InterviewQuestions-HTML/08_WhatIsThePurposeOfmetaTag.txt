1) What is the purpose of <meta> tag?
- The <meta> tag in HTML is used to give extra information about a web page to the browser and search engines.
- Simple Purpose:
It tells the browser how to handle the page — like the character set, page description, keywords, or how to adjust for different screen sizes.
- Example:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta name="description" content="This is a to-do list web app.">
- Easy Explanation:
a) charset="UTF-8" — tells the browser what type of text encoding to use.
b) viewport — helps the page look good on phones and tablets.
c) description — helps search engines understand what the page is about.
- In short: 
The <meta> tag helps the browser and search engines understand the page better.
