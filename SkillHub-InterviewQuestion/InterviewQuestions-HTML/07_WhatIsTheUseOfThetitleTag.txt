1) What is the use of the <title> tag?
- The <title> tag is used to set the title of a web page.
- It appears in two main places:
a) At the top of the browser tab
b) As the title in search engine results (like Google)
- It helps users know what the page is about and also helps in SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
- Example:
<title>My To-Do List App</title>
This will show "My To-Do List App" on the browser tab.
