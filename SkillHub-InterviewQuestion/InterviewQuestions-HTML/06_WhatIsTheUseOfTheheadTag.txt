1) What is the use of the <head> tag?
- The <head> tag in HTML is used to store important information about the webpage â€” not the content you see on the page, but things that help the browser understand and display it correctly.
a) In simple words:
- The <head> is like the brain of the webpage. 
- It contains things like:
a) The title of the page (what shows up in the browser tab)
b) Links to CSS files (for styling the page)
c) Meta tags (like how to display the page on mobile)
d) Links to fonts or icons
e) Sometimes JavaScript files
