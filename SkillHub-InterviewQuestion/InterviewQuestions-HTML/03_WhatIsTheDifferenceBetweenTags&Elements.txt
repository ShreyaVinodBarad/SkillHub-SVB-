1) What is the difference between HTML tags and elements?
- An HTML tag is just the code that you write inside angle brackets like <p>, </p>, <h1>, etc.
- An HTML element is the complete set â€” it includes the opening tag, the content inside, and the closing tag.
- Example:
<p>Hello</p>
- Here, <p> is the opening tag, </p> is the closing tag.
- Together with the text "Hello", it becomes a paragraph element.
So, tag is part of an element, and element is the full structure.
